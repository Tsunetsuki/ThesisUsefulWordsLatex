\section{Sources for existing lists for comparison}
It may be useful to compare the lists generated by the various approaches with existing word lists from educational materials:
Textbooks often feature chapters with word lists, or sentences which can be converted to word lists with a tokenizer.
The purpose is to have a point of comparison, to see if generated lists agree with existing lists, and find reasons for differences.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Language learning textbooks

    \item Language learning applications
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Duolingo: While Duolingo is the most popular language learning application as of 2024, it does not publish its word lists or course contents that is free of cost and easily convertible to a format that can be processed with NLP tools.
        \item Rosetta Stone: Rosetta Stone publishes Course contents on its website. While the contents take the form of sentences, these can be converted to word lists by using a tokenizer on the contents and creating a list in the order in which they appear in the texts.
