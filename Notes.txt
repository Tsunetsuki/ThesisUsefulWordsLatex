What is a word?
    definitions
        phonological: smallest unit isolatable by word accent and "boundary markers"
        orthographical: spaces
        syntactical: smallest permutable and substitutable unit of a sentence
        lexeme

    problems
        developed from Eurocentric perspective on linguistics, and European languages are broadly synthetic
            => word definitions may work best in synthetic languages


    glossary
        lexeme: set of words that derive from same dictionary form ("lemma")
            may also be phrase such as "black and white"
        sandhi: sound changes that occur across word boundaries (intrusive R in English)
