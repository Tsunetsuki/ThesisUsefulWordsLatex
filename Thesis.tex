\begin{abstract}
	Compiling lists of vocabulary is an essential part in language teaching.
	However, current methods used to select vocabulary rely either on pure word counting, or on the manual selection of vocabulary by experts, which is a labor-intensive process.
	This work suggests a framework for automatically compiling and evaluating lists of vocabulary that are more useful than those produced by frequency-based approaches, using public and freely accessible corpora and AI models.
	We describe the implementation of the framework in detail.
	Our implementation supports approximately 9 languages with name filtering, and 40 languages without name filtering, though evaluation was only performed on English data.
	The evaluation suggests that our compiled lists are more useful for understanding the context they were compiled for than those produced by word counting, especially for narrow contexts such as single subtitles and articles.
